## UIKit Overview

UIKit is a graphical framework for building apps on Apple platforms.

- Extensive API coverage — including the **core object**s, **view**s, and **control**s

- Compositional layouts — Create flexible visual layouts by constructing a collection view from small, reusable components and applying state-driven updates to **cell**s.

- Precise UI display — Use **Auto Layout** to create layouts that work on all Apple devices in any orientation, whether you’re **building your view programmatically** or using **Interface Builder**.

- Legacy app support — Before iOS 13, developers built all apps on UIKit. If you’re maintaining or extending legacy apps in iOS, watchOS, or tvOS, you need a good foundation in UIKit.

- Strong community adoption

- Interoperability with SwiftUI — Easily integrate UIKit and SwiftUI to use the best of both frameworks.
