## UIKit Essentials — Creating a List View

## Section 1 Create a Project

Choose "Storyboard" interface

## Section 2 Add a Collection View Controller

1. Adding a **view controller** to a **storyboard**. 
   **View controller**s act as a bridge between **view**s and your **data model**s. Each **view controller** is responsible for managing a view hierarchy, updating the content in views, and responding to events in the user interface.

2. You’ll use **Interface Builder** to create a collection view controller. Collection views can display **cell**s in grids, columns, rows, or tables.
