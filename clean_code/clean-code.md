# Clean Code

*Writing clean code is what you must do in order to call yourself a professional.*

*There is no reasonable excuse for doing anything less than your best.*

## Forward

- Honesty in small things is not a small thing.

- Small things matter.

- This is a book about humble concerns whose value is nonetheless far from small.

- God is in the details.

- Software architecture has an important place in development.

- Responsible professionals give some time to thinking and planning at the outset of a project.

- Attentiveness to detail is an even more critical foundation of professionalism than is any grand vision. First, it is through practice in the small that professionals gain proficiency and trust for practice in the large. Second, the smallest bit of sloppy construction completely dispels the charm of the larger while. That is what clean code about.

- In software, 80% or more of what we do is quaintly called ""maintenance: the act of repair.

- 5S is the pillars of Total Productive Maintenance (TPM), which is the foundation of Lean:
  
  - Organization. Suitable naming is crucial
  
  - Tidiness. *A place for everything, and everything in its place*. A piece of code should be where you expect to find it. If not, you should re-factor to get it there.
  
  - Cleaning. Get rid of the comments and comment-out code lines that capture history or wishes for the future.
  
  - Standardization. The group agrees about how to keep the workplace clean
  
  - Self-discipline. This means having the discipline to follow the practices and to frequently reflect on one's work and be willing to change.

- Inspect the machine every day and fix wearing parts before they break.

- Build machines that are more maintainable in the first place.

- Making your code readable is as important as making it executable.

- We should re-do major software chunks from scratch weekly, daily, hourly or so to sweep away creeping cruft (unwanted code).

- *Neatness as a remedy for every degree of evil.*

- As beautiful as a house is, a messy desk robs it of its splendor.

- *He who is faithful in little is faithful in much.*

- Being eager to re-factor at the responsible time, strengthening one's position for subsequent big decisions, rather than putting it off:
  
  - *A stitch in time saves nine.*
  
  - *Don't putt off until tomorrow what you can do today.*

- Calibrating the place of small, individual efforts in a ground whole:
  
  - *Mighty oaks from little acorns grow.*

- Integrating simple preventive work into everyday life:
  
  - *An ounce of prevention is worth a proud of cure.*
  
  - *An apple a day keeps the doctor away.*

- Our culture should be with attentiveness to detail.

- You should name a variable using the same care with which you name a first-born child.
