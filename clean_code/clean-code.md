# Clean Code

*Writing clean code is what you must do in order to call yourself a professional.*

*There is no reasonable excuse for doing anything less than your best.*

## Forward

- Honesty in small things is not a small thing.

- Small things matter.

- This is a book about humble concerns whose value is nonetheless far from small.

- God is in the details.

- Software architecture has an important place in development.

- Responsible professionals give some time to thinking and planning at the outset of a project.

- Attentiveness to detail is an even more critical foundation of professionalism than is any grand vision. First, it is through practice in the small that professionals gain proficiency and trust for practice in the large. Second, the smallest bit of sloppy construction completely dispels the charm of the larger while. That is what clean code about.
